        "scalable and flexible infrastructure for computing resources without the need for upfront investments in hardware.\n",
        "Key features of Amazon EC2 include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Elasticity:** EC2 instances can be easily scaled up or down based on demand. This enables users to add or remove instances as needed, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Variety of Instance Types:** EC2 offers a wide range of instance types optimized for different use cases, such as compute-intensive, memory-intensive, GPU-accelerated, and more. Users can choose instances with the right balance of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capabilities for their applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Customization:** Users can configure the operating system, networking, security settings, and other parameters of their EC2 instances. This allows for a high degree of customization to meet specific application requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Pay-as-You-Go Pricing:** EC2 operates on a pay-as-you-go model, where users are charged based on the instance types they use and the duration of usage. This makes it cost-effective, as users only pay for the resources they actually consume.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Security:** EC2 instances can be deployed within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environments, providing network isolation and control over security settings. Users can also employ security groups and access control lists to regulate inbound and outbound traffic.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Data Storage:** EC2 instances can be paired with various Amazon storage services, such as Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) for durable block storage and Amazon S3 for object storage. This enables users to attach and manage storage volumes for their instances.\n",
        "\n",

This allows for a high degree of customization to meet specific application requirements.\\n\\n4. **Pay-as-You-Go Pricing:** EC2 operates on a pay-as-you-go model, where users are charged based on the instance types they use and the duration of usage. This makes it cost-effective, as users only pay for the resources they actually consume.\\n\\n5. **Security:** EC2 instances can be deployed within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environments, providing network isolation and control over security settings.
